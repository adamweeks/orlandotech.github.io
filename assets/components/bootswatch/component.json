  "readme": "Bootswatch\n==========\n\nBootswatch is a collection of free themes for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).\n\nUsage\n-----\nHead over to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) and download the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme. Replace Bootstrap's stylesheet with this file.\n\nThe themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).\n\nFor use with Rails, check out [bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails) (Sass) and [twitter-bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails) (LESS). For use with a Yeoman app or with Bower check out [bootswatch-scss](https://github.com/nrub/bootswatch-scss).\n\n\nCustomization\n------\nBootswatch is an open source project, and you’re welcome to modify the themes further. If you’re interested, fork or follow the GitHub repository. The files of interest are in the `gh-pages` branch.\n\nEach raw theme consists of two LESS files. One is `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap and allows you to customize [these settings](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/customize.html#variables). The other is called `bootswatch.less` and introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nCheck out the README in the [swatchmaker directory](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/tree/master/swatchmaker) for step-by-step instructions on building your own swatch.\n\nAPI\n-----\n\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch.\n\nThe swatch objects are housed in an array called `themes`, and each swatch has the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `css-min`, `less`, and `less-variables`.\n\nCORS and JSONP are supported. Send your request to `http://api.bootswatch.com`.\n\nA simple demo, using mustache.js for templating: http://jsbin.com/asowud/1/edit\n\nFeedback\n------\nPlease send feedback to thomas@thomaspark.me.
